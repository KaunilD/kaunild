* Developed and implemented a Computer Vision pipeline to segment medical reports by identifying the document structure.
* Resulting document segments were then used to extract medical information using OCR.
* Entire pipeline is implemented on an Android Application using OpenCV and Tesserract OCR Libraries.
* Results obtained from OCR of user's reports were then fed into a LSTM based RNN Network to predict user's health and advice any changes to benefit their health.
