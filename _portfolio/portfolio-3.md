* Developed a web based CMS and its companion Android application for managing and streaming multimedia content to users.
* The CMS was then hosted on a local network of raspberry pi's balanced using DNS Round Robin Technique.
* Each RPi server, was then able to serve an average of 40 users while streaming Full HD content.
* Since the network is closed, this system was later augmented with a CMS for conducting weekly tests by the KJ Somaiya College of Engineering.
* Currently, OFFEE is being pursued by a start up in India by Amit Shah.
