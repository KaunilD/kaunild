* Developed a Machine Learning pipeline for Disguised Face Detection.
* Implemented a SegNet based feature detector to identify facial action units which were then used to classify disguised faces using an    SVM Classifier.
* Entire pipeline was optimized and implemented on a an FPGA and materialized into a product.
