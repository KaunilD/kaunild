Millions of people are disconnected from basic services due to lack of adequate addressing. Through this paper we proposed an automatic generative algorithm to create street addresses from satellite imagery. Our addressing scheme is coherent with the street topology, linear and hierarchical to follow human perception, and universal to be used as a uniÔ¨Åed geocoding system.
