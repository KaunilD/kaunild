I am a second year Graduate Student at the University of Colorado, Boulder where work on impactful and humanitarian 
applications of Deep Learning and Computer Vision to fields such as GIS and HCI. 
Prior to my graduate studies, I worked with Facebook's Connectivity Labs as a Software Engineer with 
[Dr. Ramesh Raskar](http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/) and [Dr. Ilke Demir](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6837MdMAAAAJ&hl=en).
You can learn more about our work at [research.fb.com/robocodes](https://research.fb.com/publications/a-holistic-framework-for-addressing-the-world-using-machine-learning/).

Currently, I am a graduate researcher at the [Institute of Cognitive Science (ICS)](https://www.colorado.edu/ics/) advised by
[Dr. Leanne Hirshfield](https://shinelaboratory.com/). My research at ICS lies at the intersection of Cognitive Science and Deep Learning

Moreover, I also work with [Dr. Michael John Willis](https://cires.colorado.edu/council-fellows/michael-willis) 
investigating the effects of climate change on permafrost and snow cover in Antarctica with using [accelerated 
routines for Computer Vision using CUDA](https://github.com/KaunilD/tensor_lib).
